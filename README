meta-openrc
================================

Introduction
-------------------------

This layer adds support for openrc to OpenEmbedded.  As openrc is not a
first-order init system in OpenEmbedded like sysvinit or systemd, we are
currently taking a couple of short cuts in order to make maintenance easier.

- Extra openrc scripts are packages in the openrc-scripts package instead of being
  bbappended to the relevant recipe.
- In order to live nicely with sysvinit, all openrc scripts are installed to
  /etc/openrc.d/ by default.

Long term it would be great to have openrc be selectable via DISTRO_FEATURES
like the other init systems, but this layer has been working well in the
interim.
